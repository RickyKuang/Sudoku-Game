# Sudoku-Game

This project was built with an accumulation of concepts that I picked up in some of my previous coursework such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, and Database Management Systems. The game has three Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty, which are first solved by the Sudoku Solver that implements a backtracking algorithm. The user can then solve the puzzle themselves, and if it matches the solved puzzle, then the game is won.

In future versions of this project, I plan to add more puzzles to the game, and I plan on refining the MySQL features by modifying the schema and adding data such as time taken on the puzzle, difficulty of the puzzle, and possibly a ranking system for different users.
